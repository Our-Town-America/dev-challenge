# React PHP Dev Challenge

This repository contains a simple, incomplete To-do list app written in ReactJS with a PHP and SQLite back end.

Please complete each of the tasks below as if this were a real-world scenario. **This is not meant to test your knowledge of React or PHP**, but to test your ability to adapt and to solve problems.

# Instructions

 1. Start the Docker Container: `docker compose up -d`
 2. Install the dependencies: `cd app/src && npm i`
 3. Build the app: `npm run build`
 4. Open the web app at: http://localhost:8080/
 5. Fix the delete button in the app.

# Tips

 - To build the app after you make a change, run `npm run build`
 - The code for the delete button is in `src/views/home.jsx`
 - The back-end code that handles deleting the item from the database is in `public/api/index.php`
 - **Ask questions.** I'm more interested in your ability to communicate and solve a problem than your expertise in coding.
